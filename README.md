Create lower triangular, upper triangular and pyramid containing the "*" character.

Star Patterns with Asterisks
This README provides a guide to generating common star patterns using the * (asterisk) character. These patterns are fundamental exercises in programming logic, particularly involving loops and conditional statements.

1. Lower Triangular Pattern
A lower triangular pattern is a right-angled triangle with the right angle at the top-left or bottom-left corner. When displayed, each subsequent row increases the number of asterisks, forming a triangular shape that expands downwards.

2. Upper Triangular Pattern
An upper triangular pattern is also a right-angled triangle, but it appears inverted compared to the lower triangular pattern. The number of asterisks decreases with each subsequent row.

3. Pyramid Pattern
The pyramid pattern is a symmetrical triangular shape where asterisks are centered, and the number of asterisks increases by two in each subsequent row, with leading spaces to maintain the pyramid structure.

How to Run the Code
To run these patterns, you can combine the functions into a single Python script.

Save: Save the Python code (e.g., all functions above) into a file named patterns.py.

Execute: Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the file, and run the script using Python:

python patterns.py
